      Today, internships are different from what they used to be. Everyone can get everything, so you're no exception.
    </p>
    <p> I was also in the same position as you. I am from a Tier 3 college where no companies visit, and nothing is
      positive here. It seems hopeless for a student like me, but somehow I figured out my way to grab everything a Tier
      1 college student gets. I got my first internship after my highschool. So I believe I can guide you all in your
      internship search. So I believe I can guide you all in your internship search.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some practical tips for finding an internship:</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Find your interest</b>
      </li>
      First, find your field of interest that excites you and start learning it more and more so that you can get some
      highlights from that field. Use YouTube to find your interests, or pick any if you're confused.


      <li>You can create a LinkedIn profile and connect with people who share your interests. As a result, you will
        explore the field more deeply and stay in the same area for a long time. You can also connect with me on
        LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitjoshihere/" target="_blank">Connect with</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Get in touch with HR and working professionals at small organisations to determine if they are willing to give
        you an internship position. Sometimes asking people will help you. (I got mine using this trick only.)
      </li>
      <li> Joining startups or small organisations will help you build your core, and you'll learn more here. Small
        startups usually have a few people, so working people get more responsibility. This will expand your expertise.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also attend seminars and workshops related to your field. Networking with professionals in your field
        can help you get new ideas and open up new opportunities.
      </li>
      <li> Make sure you do some research or work on your own before getting an internship. Look for internships that
        offer meaningful work and a chance to learn from experienced professionals. Consider researching the company
        you're considering, ensuring they have a positive track record and reputation.

      </li>
      <li> Stay away from unpaid internships. It is better to do your project than take unpaid internships. At this
        time, these things are not valid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't just do an internship for money; do it because you want exposure. Establish yourself and create a
        portfolio that will benefit you in the long run. Find an internship that aligns with your goals and helps you
        reach them. Don't waste your time and energy on something that won't pay off.
      </li>
      <li> Learn as much as you can. Try to contact the founders and co-founders to get real-life experience from their
        side.
      </li>
      <li>Keep this in mind: Try to manage your time to enjoy college life and studying. An internship should not be a
        barrier between studies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pro Tip:</b>
      Some people will tell you not to do internships in your first year because they haven't
      experienced this before. However, I'm here to tell you that doing an internship as early as possible will lead to
      more success in your career than any degree or formal education.
